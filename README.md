# Build process

**(Assuming using a build option supported by premake)**

Open the `generate_projects.bat` file, which can be found in the root directory of the project.
Depending on your tool, you might not want to build a project for Visual Studio 2019 (which is the default configuration of the file),
so change it based on whatever you plan on using to build the engine.
Finally run the file.

Run the build, enjoy!
