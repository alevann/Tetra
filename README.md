# Tetra

Tetra is a small game engine project I've made following a tutorial some time ago.
It's only executable on Windows but eventually I might decide to support other platforms.
Right now the project doesn't do much but I think it's pretty neat.

# Build process

Open the `generate_projects.bat` file, which can be found in the root directory of the project.
Depending on your tool, you might not want to build a project for Visual Studio 2019 (which is the default configuration of the file),
so change it based on whatever you plan on using to build the engine.
Finally run the file.
